    from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from February 1451 to May 1481. In Mehmed II's first reign, he
    defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the
    truce Peace of Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made
    preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and
    brought an end to the Byzantine Empire.

    It is believed that Ertuğrul is dead despite the truth being that he is actually captured by some slave traders.
    Meanwhile, Emir Sadettin convinces Dündar, Ertuğrul's brother and the new Kayı Bey, into selling Hanlı Pazar and
    moving back to Gündoğdu's tribe but is stopped upon Ertuğrul's return and is forthwith banished. After Ertuğrul's
    son, Gündüz, is kidnapped, Ertuğrul declares war against Karacahisar and is successful in conquering it. Following
    Ares' capture, Ertuğrul takes him to the Sultan and tells him to confess to the Sultan about Sadettin Köpek's
    misdeeds. The plan nearly works but Köpek is saved by the Sultan's wife, Mahperi, and leads to an event turning
    Ares, later killed by Noyan, into a Muslim. Soon after that, the Sultan is poisoned to death and Köpek's increase in
    power in the palace creates problems for the new Sultan, Gıyaseddin. Gıyaseddin allies with Ertuğrul and with the
    help of Hüsamettin Karaca, Köpek is beheaded. Halime dies in childbirth, giving birth to Ertuğrul's third and
    youngest son - the prophesied Osman. After this, Ertuğrul faces the return of Noyan but is successful in defeating
    him and his devious sister, Alangoya, who attempted to Osman. Noyan prepares for a battle, historically known as the
    Battle of Köse Dağ, and the Kayı move to Söğüt.
