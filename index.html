    <h3 class="blog-title">My Cox's Bazar Tour With my Family</h3>
    <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Khairul & Umme juyairia</span></small>
    <p>
      Cox's Bazar sea beach is the longest sea beach in the world, 120 km long, having no 2nd instance. The wavy water
      of Bay of Bengal touches the beach throughout this 120 km.

      For Bangladeshi's it doesn't get much better than Cox's Bazar, the country's most popular beach town than the
      other one 'Kuakata beach town. It's sort of a Cancun of the east. It's choc-a-bloc with massive well-architectured
      concrete structures, affluent 5 & 3 star hotels, catering largely to the country's elite and overseas tourists.
      The beach is only a bit crowded in tourist season, October to March, especially near the hotel-motel zone, but
      remains virgin during the rest of the year, April to September, when it's better to take a trip there.

    <h3 class="blog-title">My Guliakhali Sea Beach Tour With my Family</h3>
    <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Khairul & Umme juyairia</span></small>
    <p>
      We drove from Dhaka to Guliakhali beach, Shitakunda. The road to the beach is very narrow and very difficult to
      pass even one car and one 3 wheelers. So it is wise to park the car in any convenient place and take a 3 wheelers
      to the beach.

      Once their we found mud so took a boat ride; each way only BDT 30/pax. Cheap and time saver too.

      The beach is unique of its kind, see the pictures. You will get some small shops offering cold drinks and light
      packet snacks.

      Lovely place to be.
